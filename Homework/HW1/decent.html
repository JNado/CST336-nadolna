            Decentralization of DNS is the main reason for the speed of the system. <br><br>
            
            An analogy may be the best way to describe this. For example, when making a road trip, destinations that are closer to you are generally quicker to get to. This is the same with DNS queries.
            When an user makes a query, they want their query to go to the quickest to get to root DNS server. And, if we had a singular root server, say in the middle of Colorado, people in Colorado would
            complete their DNS queries rather quickly, but people in New York would be disappointed in the speed because they would have to travel across the country to get to it.<br><br>
            
            Another benefit to decentralization is the fact that since there isn't a singular DNS server to make queries too, these servers will be able to process incoming requests more quickly. But most
            importantly, attackers will not be able to do as much damage to the system if it is more difficult for them to attack these decentralized targets.
