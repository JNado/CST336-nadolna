            The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to translate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses into ones that can be more easily remembered by humans, and vice versa. For example, 
            Google's search page may be at 207.85.54.33, but remembering that number can be rather difficult, so your computer makes a DNS query with the URL "www.google.com" and is returned the IP address of
            Google's search page. The structure of the system is hierarchical and decentralized, as to provide better and quicker service. The intricacies of this system will be covered on the individual pages.
